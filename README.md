# WILDTRACKAI 


**Overview**  
WildTrackAI is a computer vision project designed to aid in wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. The system aims to use advanced machine learning techniques to process camera trap footage, identifying and tracking animal species across large datasets. This project was developed as part of applying AI in real-time applications.

### Ideal Solution Overview
The ideal solution for WildTrackAI would effectively use computer vision and deep learning algorithms to identify and track animal species in real-time from camera trap footage. The system would need to be accurate, scalable, and efficient enough to handle large datasets while being easily deployable in diverse environmental conditions.

### Key Processes Involved
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - **Data Gathering**: Collect images and videos from camera traps installed in wildlife habitats. The footage needs to be diverse to account for different lighting, weather, and animal movement patterns.
   - **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise and irrelevant frames. Techniques like data augmentation (e.g., rotating, cropping, and adjusting brightness) can help make the model more robust.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Object Detection**: Use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like YOLO or Faster R-CNN to detect and classify animals in images. Fine-tuning these models with wildlife-specific datasets can improve accuracy.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Extract key features that differentiate animal species, such as body shape, fur patterns, and movement characteristics.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - **Training**: Train the model on a labeled dataset with annotations specifying animal species and bounding boxes. Use techniques like transfer learning to speed up the process, leveraging models pre-trained on similar tasks.
   - **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensures the model is reliable before deployment.

4. **Cloud Integration for Scalability**
   - **Data Storage**: Use cloud storage solutions to handle the vast amount of image and video data efficiently.
   - **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model on cloud platforms to process incoming data in real time. Services like AWS or Google Cloud can help scale the solution based on demand.

5. **Real-Time Inference & Alerts**
   - **Inference**: Run real-time inference on incoming data to detect and identify animals. The system should provide instantaneous results, identifying species and tracking their movement across frames.
   - **Alerts & Notifications**: If the system detects endangered species or unusual patterns, it should send alerts to conservationists for immediate action.

6. **User Interface & Visualization**
   - **Dashboard**: Develop an intuitive dashboard for conservationists to monitor wildlife activity, visualize data insights, and track animal movement over time.
   - **Reports**: Generate reports summarizing key findings, such as species diversity, frequency of sightings, and animal migration patterns.

### Technologies Involved
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch for model training.
- **Computer Vision Libraries**: OpenCV, YOLO for object detection.
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud for storage and scalable deployment.
- **Database Management**: For storing image metadata and processed results.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plotly, Dash for creating user-friendly dashboards.
